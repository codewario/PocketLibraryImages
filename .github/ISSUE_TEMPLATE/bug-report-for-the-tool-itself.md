**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS Version [e.g. Windows 11 Home 22H2]
 - PowerShell Version: [e.g. 5.1]

Go to `Start > Settings > System > About` to view the Windows version you are running. Please include the `Edition` and `Version` as shown in the example.

Currently, only Windows PowerShell 5.1 is supported, due to limitations with the later versions of PowerShell not having some of the required assemblies available as they have either been deprecated or have not been open-sourced.
